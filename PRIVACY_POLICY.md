# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 14, 2024

Thank you for using *MoonGetter*. This Privacy Policy describes how *MoonGetter* ("we," "our," or "the app") handles data provided by users, specifically regarding the entry of video URLs for streaming purposes. By using *MoonGetter*, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our terms of service.

## 1. Overview

*MoonGetter* is a library and application designed for streaming videos from user-input URLs, provided these URLs point to authorized and publicly accessible sites. *MoonGetter* does not facilitate the downloading, storing, hosting, or unauthorized distribution of any content. The app operates solely as a media viewer, allowing users to stream video content within the app interface without storing any data or user information.

## 2. Information Collection and Use

### 2.1 General Data Collection

*MoonGetter* does not collect, store, or track any personal information about its users. The app does not require user accounts, profiles, or authentication mechanisms, nor does it monitor user activity across applications or websites.

### 2.2 Data Input by the User

- **User-Provided Video URLs**: The primary interaction with *MoonGetter* involves the user inputting a video URL. These URLs are used exclusively for streaming video within the app and are not stored, logged, or shared externally. Once a streaming session ends, no URL data is retained by the app.

### 2.3 Permissions

*MoonGetter* requests minimal permissions to ensure its core functionality works effectively:
- **Internet Access**: This permission is essential for streaming content directly from URLs entered by the user. *MoonGetter* does not use internet access to gather, store, or share any user data.

*MoonGetter* is committed to minimizing permissions and ensuring that user privacy remains a top priority.

## 3. User Responsibility and Content Legality

### 3.1 User Responsibility for URL Content

*MoonGetter* functions as a platform for users to access video content from URLs they provide. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that the URLs they input point to content that they are authorized to access. The app does not validate, verify, or endorse any URL provided by the user. Therefore:

- **Disclaimer**: Users are fully responsible for the legality of the URLs they input. *MoonGetter* assumes no liability for any content streamed through the app, and it is the user's responsibility to confirm that they have permission to view the content.

### 3.2 Streaming of Authorized Content Only

*MoonGetter* is intended for streaming legally accessible content available on the internet. The app does not facilitate or support bypassing security protocols, subscription models, or access restrictions on video content.

- **Prohibited Use**: The use of *MoonGetter* to stream pirated, restricted, or unauthorized content is strictly prohibited. Any misuse of the app that violates the intellectual property rights of others is solely the responsibility of the user.

## 4. Security

*MoonGetter* takes data security seriously, though it does not store personal data or user information. The app’s design is intended to minimize risks associated with data storage and unauthorized access. However, we advise users to enter URLs only from reputable, secure sites to ensure a safe streaming experience.

Since no user data is stored, there is no risk of data breach or unauthorized data sharing associated with *MoonGetter*. We continuously monitor and improve the security practices associated with app permissions and data processing to ensure privacy and security remain protected.

## 5. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

*MoonGetter* does not integrate or rely on any third-party services, analytics, tracking, or advertising platforms. No data provided by the user is shared with external services, servers, or APIs. All streaming occurs directly from URLs entered by the user, and *MoonGetter* does not serve as an intermediary in the data transmission process.

### 5.1 Lack of Data Sharing

- **No Data Transmission**: *MoonGetter* does not transmit user data to any external server. URL entries are processed locally on the device solely for the purpose of streaming video content, and no data is sent or shared externally.

### 5.2 No Third-Party Analytics

*MoonGetter* does not collect usage data, error logs, or analytics data. The app’s design does not include tracking mechanisms to monitor user activity, making *MoonGetter* a privacy-focused tool for streaming only.

## 6. Changes to this Privacy Policy

*MoonGetter* may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, services, or applicable laws. Any updates will be posted in this file, and the "Effective Date" will be revised accordingly. Users are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our data practices and user rights.

- **Continued Use**: By continuing to use *MoonGetter* after any updates to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree to the updated terms.
